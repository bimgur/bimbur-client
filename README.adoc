# Bimgur image:https://travis-ci.org/bimgur/bimgur.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/bimgur/bimgur"]

Activiti-based workflow applications to process bacterial images.

## Bimgur Clients

Bimgur offers three client applications:

### Bimgur Work

A workflow application which tracks image analysis tasks.

* Allows students to claim an image analysis task, work on it, mark it complete etc.
* Allows scientists to schedule new analysis tasks (based on defined workflows)
* Allows scientists to track image analysis progress

Technically, this is a JavaFX fat client which can be installed on any operating system.
It is contained in the `bimgur-work-fx-client` module of this repository.

### Bimgur Segment

An image segment editor.

* Allows users to manually define/adjust segments through a set of specific editing tools
* Can be integrated into "Bimgur Work" if segmentation is one task of a bigger workflow

Technically, this is a JavaFX fat client which can be installed on any operating system.
It is contained in the `bimgur-segment-fx-client` module of this repository.

### Actitivi Explorer

* An administration tool to manage the workflow engine
* Allows scientists to define new "Bimgur Work" image analysis workflows
* Allows scientists to create new "Bimgur Work" users

Technically, this is a web application which can be accessed through a browser.
It is provided out out-of-the-box by the http://activiti.org[Activiti project] and contained in the `bimgur-server` module (`activiti/activiti-explorer-*.war`).

## Architecture

TODO: Image

## Technical Project Modules

`bimgur-server`

* Activiti Explorer and Activiti REST (as WARs)
* PostgreSQL configuration
* Tomcat configuration
* Example image data

`bimgur-activiti-custom`

* Custom workflow definitions
* Bootstrap code (deploy custom workflows upon server start)
* Custom service task implementations

`bimgur-activiti-rest-client`

* Java client connecting to Activiti REST API (based on Retrofit)
* Immutable POJOs for all Activiti data models (based on JavaSlang/Jackson)
* Data exposed as observable streams (based on RxJava)

`bimgur-work-fx-client`

* Java FX application
* Using `bimgur-activiti-rest-client` to access server

`bimgur-segment-fx-client`

* Java FX application

## Server Setup

Installing a servlet container, a database, and deploying custom code can be tedious.
To simplify things, https://www.docker.com[Docker] allows to create a virtual installation via script.
The script is called `Dockerfile` and contains all necessary steps:

* Installs PostgreSQL
* Installs Tomcat
* Deploys Activiti Explorer
* Deploys Activiti REST
* Add custom Activiti code (to Explorer and REST app)

A `Dockerfile` allows to build a neat bundle of the complete server machinery, called a _docker image_.
Running an image creates a _container_, an instance of an image.

Such a container represents "a running server"; only then the client applications can be used:

* BimgurFX can e.g. be started on a student machine and will connect to the server (through a REST API)
* Activiti Explorer can be started by pointing an browser to the server's IP (details below)

For the steps in the `Dockerfile` to succeed, all custom code first need to be compiled:

### Compile Artifacts

#### Install Prerequisites

* Java SE Development Kit 8

```
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
brew install cask java
```

#### Compile Bimgur Artifacts via SBT

From the root directory (where this README is contained):

```
./gradlew build
```

### Deploy Docker Container

#### Install Docker Machine

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32744780/install-docker-toolbox-on-a-mac-via-command-line[OSX via Homebrew]:

```
# Install Cask
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask

# Install docker toolbox
brew cask install docker-toolbox

# Create the docker machine
docker-machine create --driver "virtualbox" default

# Start the docker machine
docker-machine start default

# Allows the docker commands to be used in the terminal
docker-machine env
```

For other options: https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started

#### Run Bimgur Docker Container

Creating a docker container is a two step process:

* Building an image
* Running a container (i.e. an instance of a pre-built image)

##### Build image

```
docker build --tag=bimgur .
```

##### Run container

```
docker run
  -it
  -p 8080:8080
  -v /local/path/to/bimgur/server/data:/data
  bimgur
```

WARNING: Local paths must be specified as *absolute* paths

## Run Bimgur Clients

### Run Bimgur Work

Launch `BimgurWorkApplication` from your IDE or via Gradle:

`./gradlew :bimgur-work-fx-client:run`

### Run Bimgur Segment

TODO

### Run Activiti Explorer

From any browser:

```
http://localhost:8080/activiti-explorer
```

WARNING: On OSX, `localhost` will not work. Run `docker-machine ip` to find out your docker host IP.
