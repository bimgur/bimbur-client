# Bimgur image:https://travis-ci.org/bimgur/bimgur.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/bimgur/bimgur"]

NOTE: THIS IS NO LONGER VALID AND WILL BE UPDATED SOON (migrating from Scala.js to JavaFX)

An Activiti-based workflow application to process bacterial images.

## Architecture

Bimgur uses a three-tier architecture:

* PostgreSQL Database
* Apache Tomcat Server
* Web Frontend

Two web applications are available:

* *Activiti Explorer*: Allows to _administrate_ workflows and users
* *Bimgur*: Allows to _execute_ workflows (i.e. start processes, work on tasks, etc)

Activiti Explorer is an application provided out-of-the-box by the http://activiti.org[Activiti project].
Bimgur is a Scala.js application whose code is contained in this repository.
Both, Activiti Explorer and Bimgur, connect to the same PostgreSQL database.
Bimgur uses the Activiti REST layer to do so.

## Development Setup

Installing a server, a database, and multiple frontend components can be tedious.
To simplify things, https://www.docker.com[Docker] allows to create a virtualized installation via script.
The script is called `Dockerfile` and contains all necessary steps:

* Installs PostgreSQL
* Installs Tomcat
* Deploys Activiti Explorer
* Deploys Activiti REST
* Add custom Activiti code (to Explorer and REST app)

In the end we will have a neat bundle called a _docker image_.
We will then create an instance of this image (called a container) and mount all Bimgur Scala.js client artifacts into it.
These static files will then be served via Tomcat.

For all these steps to succeed, the necessary artifacts first need to be compiled.
The Scala Build Tool (SBT) is used for this purpose: A custom `dockerize` command encapsulates all necessary tasks.

### Compile Artifacts

#### Install Prerequisites

* Java SE Development Kit 8

```
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
brew install cask java
```

* Scala Build Tool (SBT)

`brew install sbt`

NOTE: No need to install a Scala compiler (will be managed by sbt)

#### Compile Bimgur Artifacts via SBT

From the root directory (where this README is contained):

```
sbt dockerize
```

### Deploy Docker Container

#### Install Docker Machine

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32744780/install-docker-toolbox-on-a-mac-via-command-line[OSX via Homebrew]:

```
# Install Cask
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask

# Install docker toolbox
brew cask install docker-toolbox

# Create the docker machine
docker-machine create --driver "virtualbox" default

# Start the docker machine
docker-machine start default

# Allows the docker commands to be used in the terminal
docker-machine env
```

For other options: https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started

#### Activate NFS on Docker Machine

During development, it is convenient to mount Scala.js artifacts into the docker container (details below).
This allows to see any changes through a simple browser refresh, without any re-deployments.
Unfortunately, docker mounts are problematic on any non-Linux OS because of the underlying "vboxfs" filesystem.
Often, files are not synchronized properly, and are truncated when accessed via Tomcat.

As an alternative, docker-machine can be configured to use NFS:

```
brew install docker-machine-nfs
docker-machine-nfs default
```

See https://github.com/adlogix/docker-machine-nfs for details.

#### Run Bimgur Docker Container

Creating a docker container is a two step process:

* Building an image
* Running a container (i.e. an instance of a pre-built image)

##### Build image

```
docker build --tag=bimgur .
```

##### Run container

```
docker run
  -it
  -p 8080:8080
  -v /local/path/to/bimgur/client:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/bimgur
  -v /local/path/to/bimgur/server/data:/data
  bimgur
```

WARNING: Local paths must be specified as *absolute* paths

### Access Bimgur Web Applications

Both applications can be accessed through any browser:

```
http://localhost:8080/activiti-explorer
http://localhost:8080/bimgur/index-dev.html
```

WARNING: On OSX, `localhost` will not work. Run `docker-machine ip` to find out your docker host IP.

The following demo users exist for testing:

* kermit/kermit (Admin)
* gonzo/gonzo (Manager)
* fozzie/fozzie (User)

### Continuous Compilation

While working on the Scala.js client, continuous compilation makes all changes available immediately:

```
sbt ~fastOptJS
```

NOTE: Because all client files are mapped via a docker volume, there's no need to re-start the container.
