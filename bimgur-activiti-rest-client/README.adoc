# Java Activiti REST Client

This module provides a Java HTTP client connecting to the Activiti REST API.

`ActivitiRestClient` represents the entry point, exposing access to individual services (e.g. `IdentityService`).
Service names and responsibilities are in line with Activiti APIs.

# Testing

All services are tested via integration tests.
These tests require a running Activiti REST service and are therefore excluded from the default `gradle test` task.

Instead, they can be run by explicitly calling:

`../gradlew test -PrunIntegrationTests`
